    `The state of your physical body and the accompanying sensations (what is called interoception) are key to your brain's predictions and thus key to every thought, perception, and emotion you have.`,
    `We all have an inner chatterbox—a constant self-talker, self-evaluator, or commentator of whatever is going on in our lives. It is this “monkey mind” that is constantly worrying about what other people think of us. (Well, they are probably not thinking about you because they are thinking about what you think of them. That is how the self-referential monkey mind plays.)`,
    `That is the power of your subconscious, which is key to your ability to create, innovate, and imagine. Understanding the interplay between conscious and subconscious thinking and knowing how best to manage and leverage that interplay is becoming a very valuable human skill in the digital age.`,
    `If we truly trust the person we are interacting with, we often mirror his or her body language and can sync up physiologically, releasing oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a role in social bonding and is often called the trust or cuddle hormone.`,
    `A great starting point for mindset change is to consider Carol Dweck's landmark growth mindset theory.30 Dweck is a Stanford psychology professor and a researcher of human motivation. Her work delineates what it means to have a fixed versus a growth mindset. I love her work. It is so powerful yet so simple.`,
    `According to her theory, you have a fixed mindset if you believe that intelligence is innate and fixed, that the level of intelligence you are born with is your destiny and can't get any higher. According to Dweck, a fixed mindset limits your motivation and, thus, your ability to learn. If you have a fixed mindset you might say, "I have reached my potential, so why should I try?" If you adopt a growth mindset, however, you believe your intelligence is not fixed at birth and that you have the capacity to learn and get smarter. According to Dweck, a growth mindset motivates you to learn and persevere even when you struggle or fail.`,

            "The knowledge economy depends on invisible work. So does the creative economy. Their greatest value comes from the power to conceptualise, interpret and convey subjective ideas. Power is concentrated in those who understand more and communicate their perceptions with more feeling.",
            "So being a knowledge worker is not enough; nor is creativity, by itself. What else is needed? The people doing invisible work are like private detectives - slightly secretive, intuitive but logical, and opportunistic. They have to be entrepreneurs in taking responsibility for their ideas. They are design thinkers. Digital nomads.",
            "The further we move away from jobs measured by task and time towards work that is personal and subjective, the closer we move to invisible work. Each component becomes harder to see.",
            "The private, portable and elastic brain is the new office. Most of everything else we need can be carried in a phone or a backpack.",
            "The two terms - learning and education - are often used interchangeably but they come from opposite corners and have different histories and characters. To summarise, education is government-driven, formal, compulsory and age-limited. Once we leave school or university, we seldom go back. In contrast, learning is voluntary, self-driven and flexible. It is continuous and never-ending (like invisible work) because we cannot tell what we need to know in the future. ",

            "Instead, to be marketable and stay relevant in the SMA, humans will need to excel at the kinds of jobs and skills that either complement technology or are those that technology cannot do well—at least not yet. That list includes critical thinking, innovative thinking, creativity, and high emotional engagement with others that fosters relationship building and collaboration.",
            "Critical thinking is different from our usual way of thinking precisely because being “objective” is so difficult to do.  Scientific research has revealed just how hard it can be for humans to think and behave at their best in our modern world because of basic human biology and evolution. Our strong inclination is to be confirmation-biased and emotionally defensive thinkers.",
            "Another problem for us in developing SMA Skills is that today the dominant definition of “smart” is still quantity based. Today, we think, I'm smarter than you if I know more than you, and the way to determine that is by seeing who makes the fewest mistakes on “tests” of our knowledge and experience. That definition is a legacy of the Industrial Revolution's need for the mass education of workers who could do routine and repetitive.manual and cognitive tasks error-free. It's also the consequence of a knowledge-based meritocratic economy, which rewards those who “know” more and “tell” more than those who listen and inquire.",
