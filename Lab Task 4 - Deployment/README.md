# GREAD READ - Deployment

Both of the server and client side applications are separated and deployed on the same domain "great-read.com" with one side on main URL while other on a subdomain.

The app is deployed on a GAE instance on Google Cloud. Application data is stored using Storage Buckets. 

### Admin Panel:

It's the `Great Read/server` folder
Production URL: https://admin.great-read.com

### Client Side

It's the `Great Read/client` folder
Development URL: https://great-read-mu.vercel.app

This is out-dated and will be upgraded soon:
Production URL: https://great-read.com
